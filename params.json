  "body": "##### 6 years of R&D - 4 times redeveloped from scratch due to lessons learned \r\n\r\n### Main Features:\r\nE.D.D.I \r\n- is Java powered Bot-Eco-System for creating, running and maintaining customizable Chatbots. \r\n- has been built on rocked solid enterprise technologies such as Jetty Web Server and MongoDB.\r\n- is highly modularized with a loosely coupled plugin system that allows the integration of others systems.\r\n- has been designed resource-oriented & RESTful, thus scales very well.\r\n- maintains modular bot configurations that can be shared across bots and thus make “chatbot-knowledge” reusable\r\n- all chatbot configurations are versioned and can be automated tested with an custom automated-conversation testing tool\r\n\r\n### How can E.D.D.I be helpful to me?\r\n- E.D.D.I has a well thought through Conversation Lifecycle that is yet flexible enough to implement other (data) APIs and plug them in\r\n- The source code is fully available and free to use under the ASL 2.0 Licence.\r\n- If you don’t want to rely on cloud services to run your Chatbots, E.D.D.I can be easily deployed on premise via Docker or Standalone.\r\n\r\nWant to contribute to the project and make it even more powerful?",
